  - Tests user-friendly error handling
  - Looks for accessible help/contact information
  - Verifies graceful handling of system unavailability

### 5. 🔒 **Security Administrator** (`05-security-admin-compliance.spec.ts`)

**Character**: David - Security auditing and compliance monitoring

**User Stories**:

- **Security Audit**: "As a Security Administrator, I need to audit system access and monitor for security issues"
  - Verifies secure access patterns
  - Scans for exposed sensitive information
  - Monitors for security-related problems

- **Compliance Verification**: "As a Security Administrator, I want to verify data handling and privacy compliance"
  - Checks for proper data handling indicators
  - Verifies activity logging capabilities
  - Tests data export and retention controls

- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: "As a Security Administrator, I need to monitor system vulnerabilities and access patterns"
  - Assesses system exposure and attack surface
  - Monitors for suspicious access patterns
  - Validates secure error handling

## 🎨 **User Story Features**

### **Realistic User Behavior**

- **Natural Navigation**: Users try multiple paths to accomplish goals
- **Error Tolerance**: Tests handle missing features gracefully
- **User Context**: Each persona has specific motivations and knowledge levels

### **Persona-Specific Language**

- **Technical vs Non-Technical**: Different expectations for system admins vs end users
- **Role-Based Priorities**: DevOps focuses on automation, Security on compliance
- **Realistic Workflows**: Morning health checks, deployment investigations, maintenance monitoring

### **Comprehensive Coverage**

- **15 Total User Stories** across 5 distinct personas
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Based on actual daily workflows
- **Progressive Complexity**: From simple status checks to complex CI/CD automation

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Test Structure**

```typescript
test.describe('👨‍💻 System Admin: Server Monitoring', () => {
  test('As a System Admin, I want to check system health when I arrive at work', async ({
    page,
  }) => {
    // STORY: It's Monday morning, Sarah opens IMF to check if everything is running smoothly

    await test.step('Open IMF Dashboard', async () => {
      // User-focused test steps with context
    });
  });
});
```

### **User-Focused Test Steps**

- **Story Context**: Each test begins with user motivation
- **Natural Language**: Test steps mirror actual user actions
- **Flexible Assertions**: Tests adapt to current system state
- **Informative Logging**: Console output tells the user's story

### **Graceful Degradation**

- **Feature Detection**: Tests check if features exist before using them
- **Informative Fallbacks**: Missing features are logged as information, not failures
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tests work with minimal or advanced implementations

## 📊 **Results and Benefits**

### **User-Centric Testing**

✅ **Realistic Workflows**: Tests mirror actual user behavior patterns  
✅ **Persona-Based Coverage**: Different user types have different needs  
✅ **Story-Driven Development**: Features can be prioritized based on user stories

### **Practical Implementation**

✅ **Docker Integration**: Tests run in containerized environment  
✅ **Local Registry System**: Fast test execution with cached images  
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: 5 personas × 3 stories each = 15 user scenarios

### **Development Value**

✅ **Requirements Validation**: User stories serve as living requirements  
✅ **UX Testing**: Tests identify user experience issues  
✅ **Stakeholder Communication**: Non-technical stakeholders can understand test scenarios

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Team**

### **Test Execution**

1. **Docker Environment**: Use `./run-local-registry-e2e.sh` for consistent test execution
2. **Local Development**: Ensure IMF server is running on port 3000
3. **CI/CD Integration**: User story tests can validate deployment success

### **Feature Development**

1. **UI Improvements**: End user tests highlight areas needing user-friendly design
2. **Security Features**: Security admin tests identify missing compliance features
3. **Monitoring Enhancements**: Admin tests guide dashboard and alerting improvements

### **Test Maintenance**

1. **Persona Evolution**: Add new user types as the system grows
2. **Story Expansion**: Add more scenarios for each persona
3. **Validation Updates**: Keep tests aligned with actual user workflows

---

## 🏆 **Mission Accomplished**

The E2E test suite has been successfully transformed from purely technical tests to **realistic user story-based scenarios**. Each test now represents a real person with specific goals, knowledge levels, and workflows, making the tests both more valuable for validation and easier to understand for all stakeholders.

**Total Implementation**: 5 test files, 15 user stories, comprehensive persona coverage from technical administrators to non-technical end users.
