Scenario: Comprehensive Log Monitoring with Code Analysis
Description: Monitor application logs, detect errors, and automatically find problematic code areas

GIVEN monitoring is active with log file analysis
AND performance metrics collection is enabled
WHEN error messages are detected in application logs
AND response times exceed normal thresholds
THEN identify error patterns and correlate with system metrics
AND find corresponding code areas that might be causing issues
AND suggest automated remediation strategies
BUT validate fixes before applying any changes
